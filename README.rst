=======================================

This package implements the Localized Component Filtering (LCF) method for EEG
artifact rejection.

------------
Code Example
------------

Let *b_data* be a numpy.ndarray containing the result of applying a BSS method
to EEG data, and *a_data* be an alternative "cleaner" version of the previous.
Let these variable have dimensions CxTxE, where C, T and E are the number of
channels, time samples and events respectively. Then, LCF can be applied as:

.. code-block:: python

  import eeglcf
  c_data = eeglcf.lcf(b_data, a_data)

where *c_data* is a new version of the BSS data built from the mixing of
*b_data* and *a_data*.


------------
Installation
------------

To install this package, you can use the make file. From the root directory of
the package, run:

.. code-block:: bash

  make install

.. note:: The installation of the dependencies NumPy_ and SciPy_ may fail. It
  is recommended to install these packages manually.
